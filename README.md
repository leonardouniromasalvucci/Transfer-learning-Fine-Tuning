# Transfer learning and Fine Tuning

In this report, we will address an image classification problem using two deep learning techniques.<br/><br/><br/>

At first, I will train a CNN from scratch with our dataset and then, I will use transfer learning and fine-tuning using a pre-trained model to solve our deep learning problem. Intuitively, the two approaches employ different resources and processing times, since the latter has already been formed on a large amount of data. We'll see if, in addition to time and resources, the transfer learning approach also allows for greater network reliability. <br/>
