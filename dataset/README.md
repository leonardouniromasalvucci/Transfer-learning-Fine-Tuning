### Dataset

The [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UzH28Q8xki8_DMYdDgHxi40-CJ800Kaq) available for my experiment consists of different folders containing four categories of images, divided into separate folders (for each class). In particular, the dataset represents four types of atmospheric agents and it
is divided into:
* Haze
* Rainy
* Snowy
* Sunny

I have used three of the available folders to train, evaluate and test my networks, respectively, MWI-Dataset-1.1 2000, MWI-Dataset-1.2.1 and Test-Set Weather. For correct training, the folders have been partly manipulated, remaining three distinct sets to train, evaluate and test the models.
