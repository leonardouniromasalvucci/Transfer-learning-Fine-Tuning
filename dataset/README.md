### Dataset

The [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UzH28Q8xki8_DMYdDgHxi40-CJ800Kaq) available for my experiment consists of different folders containing four categories of images, divided into separate folders (for each class). In particular, the dataset represents four types of atmospheric agents and it
is divided into:
